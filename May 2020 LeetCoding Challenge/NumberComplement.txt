Number Complement
 
Given a positive integer, output its complement number. The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.

 
Input: 5
Output: 2
Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.

 
 

 
Input: 1
Output: 0
Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.





In JavaScript 

Number.prototype.toString() 
 
// method returns a string representing the specified Number object.


toString(2) - makes binary value from number"
let x = 6; console.log(x.toString(2)); //'110'


const NumberComplement = (Number)=>{

Let binary = Number.toString(2);//101
Binary = binary.split(‘’).map(num=>{
     Return num === 0 ? ‘1’ : ‘0’;
}).join(‘’);// ‘010’

return parseInt(binary,2);// 2
}


----------------------

parseInt() parses up to the first non-digit and returns whatever it had parsed. in addition to this.

parseInt(object, radix)


The radix parameter is used to specify which numeral system to be used, for  example, a radix of 2 (binary) indicates that the number in the string  should be parsed from a binary number to a decimal number.
